	* sequential-evaluation.p6: Created this sequential to evaluate how much it takes without the auto-threading. Previous, using the same program, said 110 which might be reasonable but is not awesome. I expected twice as much. Trying now with its independent multi, to see how it goes.

	 perl6 -I../../lib sequential-evaluation.p6        
Time → 229.1418178

	Yep, that makes sense.

	* evaluation.p6: Testing after adding "is pure" to the function. This is the result:

	Time → 102.70408615

	It's almost a 10% improvement, a bit more over the initial, hyper-based thing. I like that.

	* evaluation.p6: Adds a benchmark for testing the difference between hyper and race, and also, when done, different threads and batch size.
	Using race: Time → 115.2381328
	Now changed to hyper.
	Hyper: Time → 122.016497

	Only slightly worse, but definitely worse.

	Changing back to race, but increasing the batch to 8.
	Time → 125.9312309

	That was probably not a good call. Let's change the degree to 8.
	Time → 112.4315437

	That was slightly (but noticeably) better.
