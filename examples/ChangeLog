	* population-mixer.p6: Testing a possibly multithreaded population mixer, with not a lot of success, because the evolutionary algorithm gets stuck eventually. Not a good sign. 

	It takes a good while to find the solution, ~60000 generations, and that lowering the "generation gap" to just 8. We will have to do something about this... Maybe test population sizes until they work..

	* concurrent-evolutionary-algorithm.p6: New algorithm which includes mutation. Testing for number of evaluations. Results

	Result [Found => 5043 Found => 5033 Found => 5584 Found => 5343 Found => 5588 Found => 4631 Found => 5117 Found => 4232 Found => 4371 Found => 5133 Found => 4741 Found => 4745 Found => 5269 Found => 4047 Found => 4292 Found => 4918 Found => 4165 Found => 4488 Found => 4413 Found => 4914 Found => 4177 Found => 4279 Found => 4255 Found => 4373 Found => 4358 Found => 4648 Found => 5740 Found => 4327 Found => 5284 Found => 4073]

	Testing now for bigger chromosomes: perl6 -I../lib ./concurrent-evolutionary-algorithm.p6 --max-evaluations=50000 --population-size=512 --length=128

	Result [Found => 16638 Found => 15558 Found => 17237 Found => 17792 Found => 16242 Found => 13005 Found => 18091 Found => 14995 Found => 15276 Found => 16061 Found => 18152 Found => 16934 Found => 15790 Found => 18165 Found => 15518 Found => 17669 Found => 16282 Found => 16202 Found => 16806 Found => 16486 Found => 15920 Found => 17341 Found => 15394 Found => 16664 Found => 16311 Found => 17195 Found => 17944 Found => 15538 Found => 18023 Found => 17429]

	* concurrent-selecto-recombinative-EA.p6: Adds parameter printing
	for experiments. Testing now with tournament-size = 3. No good
	result is coming...
	Tournament size has to be either 3 or 4. It hangs up with 5. It
	goes down to 0 with 3. Too slow, individuals are getting pushed
	back Result 0

	* concurrent-selecto-recombinative-EA.p6: Start making experiments
	for finding out the population needed in a selecto-recombinative
	algorithm.
	For population size = 256, Result 0.9
	Result 0.9 --diversify-size=16

	perl6 -Ilib
	examples/concurrent-selecto-recombinative-EA.p6
	--population-size=512 ➜ Result 1

	perl6 -Ilib examples/concurrent-selecto-recombinative-EA.p6
	--diversify-size=4 → 0.933333
